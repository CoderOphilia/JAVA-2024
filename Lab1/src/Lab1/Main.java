		 Exercise 11
		    From 1925 through 1963, Burma Shave advertising signs appeared next to highways across the United States. 
			There were always four or five signs in a row containing pieces of a rhyme, followed by a final sign that read 
			Burma Shave. For example, one set of signs that has been preserved by the Smithsonian Institution reads as 
			follows:
			Shaving brushes
			You’ll soon see ’em
			On a shelf
			In some museum
			Burma Shave
			Find a classic Burma Shave rhyme on the Web, making sure the fifth line is Burma Shave. Write, compile, and 
			test a class that displays the slogan. Save the class as BurmaShave.java.
