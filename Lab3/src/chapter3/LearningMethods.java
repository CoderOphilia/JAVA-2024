7. Assume that a gallon of paint covers about 350 square feet of wall space. Create an application with a main()
method that prompts the user for the length, width, and height of a rectangular room. Pass these three values 
to a method that does the following:
❯ Calculates the wall area for a room
❯ Passes the calculated wall area to another method that calculates and returns the number of gallons of 
paint needed
❯ Displays the number of gallons needed
❯ Computes the price based on a paint price of $32 per gallon, assuming that the painter can buy any 
fraction of a gallon of paint at the same price as a whole gallon
❯ Returns the price to the main() method
The main() method displays the final price. For example, the cost to paint a 15-by-20-foot room with 10-foot 
ceilings is $64. Save the application as PaintCalculator.java.
